# ðŸŒž Tell Me Something Good

A feel-good Python/Flask API that scrapes heartwarming headlines from multiple positive news sources like Good News Network, Positive News, and The Optimist Daily.

Designed to power a mobile app that delivers a daily boost of joy â€” complete with randomized stories, caching, and push notification support.

---

## Features

- Scrapes articles from 3 curated sources of good news
- Returns a randomized selection of uplifting headlines
- Caches results daily to avoid repeat scraping
- Optional `?limit=10` param for custom batch sizes
- Filters out duplicate stories based on headline text
- Simple JSON API, built with Flask

---

## How It Works

The backend scrapes stories using BeautifulSoup, merges and deduplicates them, then returns a fresh mix of headlines via a `/api/news` endpoint.

To reduce unnecessary scraping, results are cached in a local JSON file and only refreshed once every 24 hours.
